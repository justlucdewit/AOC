# Advent of code day 1

Its this time of the year again where I have to wake up at 6 am to solve
stupid programming problems :D. unfortunately i woke up a little to late
which made me miss the first 5 minutes that the day 1 challenge was
online. However, after reading the introduction to the problem, i quickly
wrote down some code to solve the problem, and after only 7:23, i got my
answer in, despite me making some dumb mistakes (i switched the right
and left operand of the > operator).

Part 2 was basically a copy paste, but with some addition, today was
super straight forward!
